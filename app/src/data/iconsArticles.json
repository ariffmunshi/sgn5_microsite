That job was everything I could've asked for — an incredible team, meaningful work, a mission I truly believed in, and fair pay.",

					"Although I'm no longer on a career break, my learning hasn't stopped. I continue to stay connected to local communities through my work, Scouting, and women's travel networks. At its core, sustainable finance — and any impact-driven work, really — isn't about speaking over others. It's about listening, understanding, and amplifying the voices of those who have long been overlooked, understanding how and where I hold power, and using it with humility to better the world."
